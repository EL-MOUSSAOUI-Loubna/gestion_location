This is a simple house renting project that I'm proud of
it is the first time i create a project (actually a mini project) in a small duration (10 days i think ?), where i worked with new features (maps and localstorage), all while keeping up with my studies and exams.
For now, I will keep everything as it is, and I will fix bugs and errors, add new features, and adjust the design someday later.


commandes i used : 
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
npm install react-router-dom@6
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4 postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install axios
npm install redux react-redux
npm install leaflet react-leaflet@4.2.1
